Early Childhood
Incidents and experiences
Deserted by my father at 2 1/2 years,
shortly before brother's birth.
Mother was with her semi-invalid parents.
Great grandfather's playing with my
brother and me. He was an ex-slave
of Scotch-Irish desent, African
ancestry either remote or non-existent.
He died when I was six years old.
Mother taught school in the rural community
where we lived.
KKK moved through the country,
burning negro churches, schools, flogging
and killing. Grandfather stayed
up to wait for them to come to
our house. He kept his shotgun
within [reach] hand reach
at all times. My aunt, a widow,
and her five small children came
to our house at night. We could
not undress and go to bed at night.
The doors and windows were
boarded and nailed tight from the
inside. I stayed awake many

2
nights, keeping vigil with Grandpa.
I wanted to see him kill a
Ku Kluxer. He declared the
first to invade our home would
surely die. This when I was six
or seven. None came in our house.

My mother was a very beautiful woman
and a good mother to us, also a
devoted daughter of her own parents.
She was attractive to [crossed out] men
and there was one, I was so
fond of that I wanted him for
my father. He was a tall,
handsome bachelor who was
found murdered mysteriously. Though I don't know
what their relationship was or
might have been, his death
was a great loss to me.

As Grandpa, already crippled and
hardly able to walk, become more
feeble, I stayed near [with] him more
than ever. I washed his feet at
night, soaking his rheumatism twisted
toes and stiff legs & ankles in Mullen
water and various concoctions.

3
and remedies that people said were
good for the rheumatism. This was
my special duty and I was
always ready with the basin
to make sure no one else would
do the foot washing. He was tall,
thin and very caucasian in
appearance. He had long, very
straight, thickly growing white
hair that I liked to comb.
He taught me to plant corn, chop
and plow cotton, milk cows etc.
I learned to cook, by observing
my grandmother and could
prepare a simple meal almost as
soon as I was tall enought to
see the stove top. I learned
to sew by piecing quilts. Made
the first one when I was six.
Mother was away from home much
of the time working. I adored my
brother and never wanted him
to get a whipping for being
naughty. Being a normal boy,
he was inclined to be playfully

mischievous at times. He was spoiled
and often really naughty. It seemed
that I received more whippings
for not "telling on him" than for
doing things myself that may
have provoked punishment.
Once when he was just 1 year old,
Grandmother was going to
spank "Brother". I pleaded
with her to leave him be,
for "he was only a little baby
who had no mama and no
papa." (Mother was away working
and my father [was still away] never returned to live with us.
She spared him that time.
Grandpa was especially
devoted to my brother and
Brother was equally fond of
him. He was not afraid of grandpa as [we] as the
rest of [us] the grand children,
my cousins and I. He had
a loud voice and could
speak roughly when angry.

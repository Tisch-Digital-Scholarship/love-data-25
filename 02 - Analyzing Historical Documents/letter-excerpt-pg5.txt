Dear Rev. King:

It is impossible to express the shock and grief I felt when you were hurt. It is good to hear that you (crossed out)<have a chance> are recovering, but I am sorry you have to suffer because of an insane, wanton act. I have read your book and liked it very much. Your mention of me is a great compli-ment that I appreciate.

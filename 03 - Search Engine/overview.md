# Let's build a search engine
## Explore the past with Natural Language Processing

In this workshop, we explore the basics of creating a search engine. We cover indexing querying and ranking results with the TF-IDF algorithm. We then demonstrate how to put these principles into action with a premade [search engine creator application](https://search-engine-creator.streamlit.app).
